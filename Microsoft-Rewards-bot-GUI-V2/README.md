## Features
I added all features from two last version plus some new features:
  - Account management and display account log, also you can import your accounts from other versions of my bots.
  - Support proxy for each account (Proxy without authentication)
  - Support Mobile user agent for each account (Don't add or change this if you don't know what this is)
  - You can choose to which part of Rewards you want to be done by Bot
  - Support headless browser
  - You can use session to create profile to save cookies of your account in that (By activating this it creates so many files and it takes n GBs of files if 
  many accounts which is totally normal)
  - Shutdown your system after farm if you enabled it
  - Fast mode for high speed connection which half delays
  - Auto start to run farmer on startup application
  - Timer to run the Bot at your choosen time
  - You can use Edge webdriver instead of Chrome
  - Send daily report to your Discord server and your Telegram
  - Easily update user agents without changing code
  - Theme changer for the app
